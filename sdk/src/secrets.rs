//! Per-app secret declarations.
//!
//! Each plugin declares the named credentials it needs via the
//! `secrets = [...]` field on the [`dyn_aomi_app!`](crate::dyn_aomi_app)
//! macro. The host reads the declared slots from the plugin manifest and
//! gates app load on the user having ingested every `required: true` slot
//! into the runtime secret vault. At tool-call time the host pre-resolves
//! the slots for this app and injects raw values into
//! [`DynToolCallCtx::secrets`](crate::DynToolCallCtx::secrets); tools read
//! them via [`resolve_secret_value`](crate::resolve_secret_value).
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use aomi_sdk::Secret;

//!     "LIMITLESS_API_KEY",
//!     "Limitless CTF Exchange API key id (from the dashboard).",
//!     true,
//! );
//! const SECRET: Secret = Secret::new(
